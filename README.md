Our project is titled Class Attendance Management System (CAMS). It is a tool used to record, monitor, and manage students' attendance in a class. It is designed to track students' personal details and attendance, focusing on the Database module over a 10-week period. The system allows students to view their attendance records, while lecturers can update attendance as needed, providing a streamlined solution for managing student participation in academic modules.
